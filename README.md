# WP/LR Sync Extensions
Extensions are the glue between WP/LR Sync and gallery plugins or the themes. 

## Internal Extensions
They are already included with WP/LR Sync. You will also find them here, for debugging and fixing purposes.

* Post Types (developed by Jordy Meow)
* Real Media Library (developed by Matthias Gunter)

## External Extensions
Each of those are basically a WordPress plugin. The folder can be added into the /plugins folder in WordPress. They are here so that you can get them and contribute as I am not actively working on them.

* Photo Gallery
* NextGen
* Media Folder
* CosmoThemes
