NextGEN will be synchronized with Lightroom. This magic requires also the WP/LR Sync plugin to be installed.

== Description ==

NextGEN will be synchronized with Lightroom (your photos, collections, and collection sets). This magic requires also the WP/LR Sync plugin to be installed.

This extension for WP/LR Sync has been developed by the author of WP/LR Sync. However, ideally, this extension should be enhanced by geeky users and the NextGEN developers.
